# Hi!
### My name is Sylvie. I make software.
(I go by she/it.)

I like to code things.

## Who am I?
I'm a hobbyist programmer. 

Contact me in these following ways:
- by emailing `hi` at `sylvie.software`, or anywhere at `nightshade.network`
- ...or my preferred method, talk to me directly on Discord. The handle is [the .NET namespace that contains P/Invoke](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke), *but introduce yourself first elsewhere, otherwise I'll reject your request.*

## What do I do?
I write code, sometimes make music and play Final Fantasy XIV.

I like the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [C#](https://dot.net) programming languages a lot.

## What have I made?
Too much to list, from [OpenGL/ImGui integration with C#](https://github.com/lostkagamine/OpenTK_ImGui_Backends) to [crimes against humanity](https://github.com/lostkagamine/rustic-c). Ask me about some of my weirder projects.

I am also founder and head of [Project Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura), an open-source **online network revival service** for defunct 2018 arcade racing game "[Wangan Midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangan_Midnight) Maximum Tune 6", created by Bandai Namco. My hosted instance boasts over 2,500 registered users!

I run [Nightshade Network](https://nightshade.network), a collection of private 'friend cloud' services for me and friends. It's powered by [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com), [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org).

## What do I use?
My PC setup consists of a custom desktop computer:
- AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D (12C, 24T) @ 4.40GHz
- 32GB of DDR5-6000 RAM
- AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT (20GB)
- WD_BLACK SN770 2TB NVMe
- Crucial P3 2TB NVMe
- AOC CQ27G2SE (2560x1440, 165Hz)
- Logitech G502 X Plus
- Keychron Q5 Pro

Software-wise, I like using:
- Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise (x86_64) @ `ARCADION`
- Text editor: Visual Studio Code
- IDE: JetBrains Rider
- DAW: FL Studio 21

# Use of my software
**Unless stated otherwise, any and all public repositories on this account are unsupported. Please do not ask about how to use them, as they are personal tools, more often than not.**
You may still report issues, and I may get to them, but it is not a guarantee. I battle with burnout quite often,
and I would like to keep the threat of falling into it to a minimum.

That said, please respect the licenses. Most of my work is licensed MIT.

# About private repositories
A lot of work is under private repositories. I don't usually have any particular reason for keeping the code private,
but it's most likely because I don't think the code is finished or ready enough to be in the public eye.

Active projects will be open-sourced eventually.
