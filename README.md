Programmer. Jack of all trades, master of one.
Wannabe reverse-engineer and gamehacker; big proponent of running inside address spaces that aren't your own; voted "world's only Windows DLL loader fan" 2 years running.

C# is my favourite programming language of all time. Will understand if you speak in English or Italian, might understand if you speak in Japanese.
