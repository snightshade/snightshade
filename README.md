Programmer. Jack of all trades, master of one.
Wannabe reverse-engineer and gamehacker; big proponent of running inside address spaces that aren't your own; voted "world's only Windows DLL loader fan" 2 years running.

C# is my favourite programming language of all time. Will understand if you speak in English or Italian, might understand if you speak in Japanese.

Spicier stuff is on [my Git server](https://git.nightshade.network).

Pretty important note: **all projects from before 2024 are explicitly disavowed until specified otherwise.** Drawing my attention to them will just cause me to set them private. Moreover, all projects on this GitHub page come with absolutely zero guarantees of functionality, or of being easy to modify. Most of the time, they are tools for personal usage.
